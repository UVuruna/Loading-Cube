"""DOCS.md's coverage guard (root DOCS.md, "Tiers — Which File Gets Which Docs").

Every source file gets the docs its TIER requires:

    Trivial      -> no __about/, no __flow/ (one line in the folder's
                    ___folder.md instead)
    Standard     -> __about/{name}.md only
    Algorithmic  -> __about/{name}.md AND __flow/{name}.md -- and the flow doc
                    must have EARNED its place (root DOCS.md, owner decision
                    2026-08-01): a Standard-tier file caught with an unearned
                    __flow/ doc fails here too
    tests/       -> NO per-file docs at all, ever -- only the folder's own
                    ___tests.md

This file is the project's single source of truth for every source file's
tier assignment (root MIGRATE-DOCS.md: "the project's test_docs_coverage.py
encodes the tier assignment ... changing a file's tier means updating THIS
test in the same commit").
